### About::
this project has been deigned to facilitate 
the learning of python 3+

with the scope is to devlop a simple 2nd game application

user input and rendering handled primary by SDL though expanding
into opengl is likely.(for effects paticlarly particals)

the flocking and other movement AI is designed off of
Ian Millington's  theory and pseudocode in
AI for games 3ed. 

## Game Discrption 

the game is based around a 2nd open level
with platforms and "terstiral formations that
plantlife grose on and potenatal spawners may habidate"
flocks of little swadrance will be battling ench ohter for control
of the platforms... or mostly just zooming around crashing into each other

the client must take their craft and navgate though the world. 
they may choose to engage or just mind their own buxsness exploring 
diffrent zones, and once the've found a path to the next world.
they can jump to it.
